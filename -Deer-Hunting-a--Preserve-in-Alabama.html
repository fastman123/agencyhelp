When the Pritchett family converted this 6,000-acre plantation from agriculture to wildlife, populations of Alabama Whitetail deer surged. Located in the heart of the southeast’s Black Belt region in Union Springs, Alabama, Great Southern Outdoors is home to an abundant population of whitetail deer, eastern wild turkeys, and a variety of other native wildlife species. We operate year-round, offering unforgettable <a href="https://www.greatsouthernoutdoors.com/alabama-deer-hunting-2/">Alabama deer hunting</a>, turkey hunting, quail hunting, pheasant shooting, and hog management. By operating on a year-round management program, we are able to monitor our local populations of wildlife, which allows us to constantly work on improving our habitat to support the local wildlife.  <br><br>When you book a hunt with Great Southern Outdoors, you get more than just a hunt in the great state of Alabama. All of our hunts include private lodging, incredible southern cuisine, and a family style atmosphere that keeps our clients coming back year after year. Rex Pritchett began hosting corporate hunts at the plantation in 1989 before he opened up the lodge to the general public just ten years later. With over 30 years of experience in managing the land for wildlife, Great Southern Outdoors has become a premiere destination for those wanting a true Alabama hunting experience. Whether you want to chase an Alabama trophy buck, call in an eastern wild turkey, or watch our professionally trained bird dogs work their magic on the quail fields, Great Southern Outdoors is the perfect destination for you.<br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Ev3m3Ns8kc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><p>                    </header>                     <section>                        <h2>Alabama Deer Hunting</h2><p>Our true passion at Great Southern Outdoors is deer hunting. Bullock County is home to the highest density of deer in the state of Alabama, and we have the history to prove it. This property has been heavily management for whitetail deer for over 30 years, and we have been able to see a drastic increase in the overall health of our herd, including antler size. After seeing several unusually high-scoring bucks for a free-range plantation in south Alabama, the Great Southern Outdoors 20 Inch Club was formed. It has now become a fun challenge for our new and returning customers to hunt for a whitetail buck with a spread of 20” or more that will make them an elite member of the 20 Inch Club.Not only does Great Southern Outdoors have an abundant population of whitetail deer, but we also have large populations of eastern wild turkeys. Our success rates on harvesting turkeys at Great Southern Outdoors is over 90%. We only offer 10 to 12 spots each year for hunters to get their chance at an impressive Alabama gobbler, which is what makes our turkey hunts so popular. Whether you are confident in your calling skills or you would rather one of our professional guides call for you, we can customize your hunt to you so that your Alabama turkey hunt will be one you won’t forget. <br><br>If you’ve heard of Union Springs, Alabama, you already know that our little town is nicknamed the “Field Trial Capital of the World.” This is due in part to the rich history surrounding the sacred traditions of running bird dogs in field trial competitions at several plantations across the area. Great Southern Outdoors is keeping the tradition of hunting quail with bird dogs alive by offering classic quail hunts with our professionally trained bird dogs.

Unfortunately, our area has experienced a surge in wild hog populations. We combat this by offering  3-day hog hunts outside of deer and turkey season. As part of an eradication program through the state of Alabama, we have a permit that allows us to hunt these hogs at night over bait. No night scopes or thermal imagers required; our Moultrie feeders are equipped with motion detector lights that activate when an animal approaches the feeder. These hog hunts are a very exciting way to manage our hog population while allowing hunters to visit our lodge at any time throughout the year.<br><br>						Whether you’re looking for an Alabama whitetail, an eastern wild turkey, quail or pheasants, or even a wild Alabama boar, Great Southern Outdoors has you covered. Our #1 staff of outdoor professionals are here to help you with an Alabama hunting trip you won’t forget.<br><iframe src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/webeast2/Hunting-Alabama.html" width="600" height="580" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><br>						</p>                    </footer>                </article>                           </div> <!-- #main -->        </div> <!-- #main-container -->                <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script>        <script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="https://storage.googleapis.com/mycss/js/vendor/jquery-1.11.2.min.js"><\/script>')</script>        <script src="https://storage.googleapis.com/mycss/js/plugins.js"></script>        <script src="https://storage.googleapis.com/mycss/js/main.js"></script>    </body></html><br><br><p><a href="https://1aseo.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/-Deer-Hunting-a--Preserve-in-Alabama.html">Alabama turkey hunting</a><br> <a href="https://1aseo.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/-Deer-Hunting-a--Preserve-in-Alabama.html">Alabama hog hunting</a><br> <a href="https://1aseo.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/-Deer-Hunting-a--Preserve-in-Alabama.html">Alabama hunting</a><br> <a href="https://1aseo.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/-Deer-Hunting-a--Preserve-in-Alabama.html">Alabama pheasant hunting</a><br> </p><br></body><br></html>
