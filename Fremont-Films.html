It's good to return in time and discover a little history. Given that my family likes motion pictures, it's great to get a little history of how films were created back in the day. I took my little 8 year old smarty with me. He liked it! Examine the film times. They reveal quiet movies. Take the time to go through the flip books. So fun!! Of course I got one for him as a souvenir of our journey! About $5. Also a great afternoon to stroll around the Old Niles district.</p><p>This is a quaint little out of the way area that houses the museum. My partner, a lifelong native of the Bay Location, never ever understood it was there or that movies had actually been made here in the quiet movie age. A little piece of fun ...

But I guess I'm jaded by other offerings at classical cinema and museums. The museum lies in a Nickelodeon theater that was converted over the years for other uses. So it misses the atmosphere of a restored theater, especially the more comfy, and better-appointed theaters that replaced the Nickelodeons. And the collection is really little-- it can be looked at quickly in a couple of minutes. And when looked at, that's practically it ...</p><p>museum.<br />This place is special. It is the only place in the SF Bay area that reveals quiet cinema on a weekly basis. The only thing I'm aware of that does it anywhere near as often in the US is the Silent Clown Series in New York City City, however that is only weekly during a limited season of the year. The NESFM is weekly each week, except during the week of the annual SF silent movie celebration, because they do not wish to kill that celebration. You have live piano accompaniment, along with excellent quiet movie specialists and stars on hand, such as Baby Peggy and Linda Wada visit occasionally. It's just wonderful. And this does not even mention the Chaplin and Snub Pollard and Broncho Billy things.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4A069MZxryE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Niles Essanay Silent Film.<br />Today, the Niles Essanay Silent Movie Museum provides an entertaining window into a greatly various era, however likewise provides an increasingly important service. As modern-day culture moves even more and further away from the quiet era, not only its artifacts but also its memories are being lost. Therefore, this more than a museum-- it is, and will remain, a bank for those memories.</p><p>We went to the saturday night showing of quiet movies, and it was a real begin the pants. When we first got to the museum at 6:30 pm, the doors were closed for the 7:30 program, so we decreased the street to have dinner at the Essanay cafe (rave review is forthcoming). While at the coffee shop, our meal was running long, and someone from the theater actually called the cafe to see if any supper visitors were concerning the show, and they wanted to hold up the start for 5 minutes. How nice is that? As soon as we got in, the theatre was loaded, and an emcee gave many anecdotes about the films we will see, and after that presented the live pianist I had no concept what went into revealing these movies, however our first quiet brief was revealed on a hand cranked projector! The gentleman playing the piano was spot on, with music the entire time, offering terrific thematic music. There was a brief intermission with free popcorn and ice cream readily available and sandwich shop to buy sweet or soda. There were individuals present who have been involved with the Niles quiet film scene for years, and it was refreshing to understand this art is valued so deeply. Their spring movie schedule is quite full, revealing different movies weekly. This is absolutely a special experience regional only to us!</p><iframe class="YMEQtf W4jnE DnR2hf KfXz0b" style="height: 648px;" src="https://drive.google.com/embeddedfolderview?authuser=0&amp;id=1a8fHv9nMlYUm8sQm9YlnheQqfQAC_Ad2#list" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms allow-same-origin allow-popups-tscape-sandbox" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" aria-label="Drive Folder, Fremont California"></iframe><br><br><p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/webeast2/Niles-Essanay-Silent-Film-Museum.html">Fremont's Silent Films</a><br> <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/webeast2/Niles-Essanay-Silent-Film-Museum.html">Films Fremont CA</a><br> <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/webeast2/Niles-Essanay-Silent-Film-Museum.html">Niles Essanay Silent Film Museum</a><br> <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/webeast2/Niles-Essanay-Silent-Film-Museum.html">Silent Film Museum in Fremont CA</a><br> </p><br></body><br></html>
