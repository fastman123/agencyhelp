It is free to join and requires a Paypal account to buy to sell.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>It is ran by Chris Walker better know for his very fast videos on seo as SEO Super Star. Legiit  was cr eated out of the pain that Konker turned into for sellers and buyers and all want  a more stable platform. Legiit has done that, and more it has opened up intrue seosuperstar style, fast and good at the same ime, yes  rare quailty today.<br> They also have a good affilte program, that money can quickly and easliy be made.<br><h2><a title="Legiit" href="https://www.legiit.com/promotelegiit/2Jl0RjjZxZm15eAM">Legiit.com</a></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The gigs there are better than fiverr and most other gig sites, as they are geared toward real seo.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Buy SEO Services Online</h2><p>When many are looking for help for their webites rankings they turn to fiverr. Fiverr gig can be good and bad at the same time. Many of the gigs are fine for certian countries, but not so good for USA. That because Googles alogrithms are usually aimed at certian countries, but not all. Fiverr marketing can be used but you really need to undertsand how the seo work is going to be done. That is not always possible with Fiverr link building. Not all are this way as I have fround very good gigs there.You can see the reviews which is kinda how fiverr gig ranking happens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Hire SEO Freelancer</h2><p>You can try this but again your not sure how it will turn out and it usually cost more this way than using a gig with the known costs upfront.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>SEO Gigs - Legiit</h2><p>We want t show you one of the gigs we found on legiit. Its called Cloud Stacker. They take several cloud properties and link them in a the standard link tier ,that is site 1 links to your targeted url, then site 2 links to site one, site 3 links to site two, ect, This stacks the cloud site together making a powerful backink that usually out ranking most PBNs and is very clean link juice. Its a one time charge . I see these sites rank all the time and yes even below the map pack in local seo.
